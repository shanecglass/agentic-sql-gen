        - Resolve aliases within subqueries relative to their scope.
        - Identify and process both explicit and implicit joins.
        - Infer the specific JOIN type (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) or label it as UNKNOWN if it cannot be determined. Queries that only specify JOIN should be treated as INNER JOIN.
        - Handle self-joins, multiple join conditions, and the USING clause. Ignore any UNNEST conditions.

    Context:
    Table schemas are provided as a Python dictionary. The dictionary key is a dataset name and value is a nested table dictionary for each table in the dataset.
    The key for each nested dictionary is the table name and the value is a list of dictionaries representing the columns in the table.
    Each dictionary in the list defines a single column in the table with the column name, nullability, and data type.
    It is critical that your query only uses columns that are defined in this dictionary. No other columns should be used. Treat this dictionary as the definitive source of information about the database structure.

    Carefully analyze the task and follow these steps:

    1. **Identify Tables:** Determine which tables are needed to fulfill the request.
    2. **Select Columns:** Using the schemas dictionary, identify the necessary columns and their data types.
    3. **Construct Query:** Write the SQL query, ensuring correct join conditions, filter criteria, and data type handling.

    Table Schemas:
    {bq_schema}

    ERD Summary:
    {erd_json}

    Your response should be the SQL query and an explanation of why each column and join relationship was chosen.
